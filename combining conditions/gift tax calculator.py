""" Some say paying taxes makes Finns happy, so let's see if the secret of happiness lies in one of the taxes set out in Finnish tax code.

According to the Finnish Tax Administration, a gift is a transfer of property to another person against no compensation or payment. If the total value of the gifts you receive from the same donor in the course of 3 years is â‚¬5,000 or more, you must pay gift tax.
